# PDF-OCR-and-data-analysis

## Brief

Contents of this repo will be tightly related to my Bachelor's thesis. I will get data [here](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/) for my Bachelor's thesis. Therefore I'll automate the process of getting the numbers from the financial statements. Done by OCR and the help of Tesseract.

In addition, this repo includes files for fetching data from various websites through HTTP-requests, for instance getting squad value and average attendance throughout the years. All of these values will be the base of data visualization and analysis that are going to be utilized in my thesis.

At the moment the values scraped are ready and manually checked to be correct. The values are in [this](https://github.com/jerempa/PDF-OCR-and-data-analysis/tree/main/csv_and_txt_files) directory. There are also regression results based on them. Some data visualization has also been done in transfermarkt_data_visualization.py-file.


Update 29.6.23: Multiple linear regression was the basis of my thesis. The repo is probably not going to get updated in the future and the code is not going to get cleaned up. The repo was unused for a long time after the regression results were gotten. The reason for this is that Python was not needed anymore as I was focusing on the writing process of the thesis. This repo contains OCR, data collection, parsing and analysing. Thesis received grade 5 out of 5.
