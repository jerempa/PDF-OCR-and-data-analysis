# PDF-OCR-and-data-analysis

## Brief

Contents of this repo will be tighly related to my Bachelor's thesis. I will get data [here](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/) for my Bachelor's thesis. Therefore I'll automate the process of getting the numbers from the financial statements. Done by OCR and the help of Tesseract.

In addition, this repo includes files for fetching data [here](https://www.transfermarkt.com/) through HTTP-requests, for instance getting squad value and average attendance throughout the years. All of these values will be the base of data visualization and analysis that are going to be utilized in my thesis.
